# cv-open-code
Pretty much every site (company) desires you to register on their site with different forms, other CV formats.
Looks like last year I decided to make a first step to 'try to solve this' by initiating a new html / xml cv format, and if HR or PR feels the need of code style marketing, I used one as well.

I am not alone on the opinion of the 'CV problem':

09:27 they've never seen me before so I've made this mistake before and you guys 

09:31 know a resume correlates loosely with whether or not you know how to do a job 

09:37 if your resume shows for sure that you could do a job you'd never lose one 

09:44 they'd never be a bad hire they'd never be an employee that didn't work out 

09:48 correlates loosely with whether or not you know how to do the job so do I say
